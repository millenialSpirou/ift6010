* notes
The Steps section is the TODO list. It seems that transformer is a special case
of attention models. The paper [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473][arxiv Neural Machine Translation by Jointly
Learning to Align and Translate]] is referenced a lot and its pictures used in the
easier "pop" links I've found. I think understanding what attention is will be
the first step for me at least.

*This paper contains Positional Encoding which used by transformer*

"The dominant approach to date encodes the input sequence with a se- ries of
bi-directional recurrent neural networks (RNN) and generates a variable length
output with another set of de- coder RNNs, both of which interface via a
*soft-attention mechanism* (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015)."

"Compared to recurrent layers, convolutions create representations for fixed
size contexts, however, the effective context size of the network can easily
be made larger by stacking several layers on top of each other. This allows to
precisely control the maximum length of dependencies to be modeled."

"Convolutional networks do not depend on the computations of the previous time
step and therefore allow parallelization over every element in a sequence.
This contrasts with RNNs which maintain a hidden state of the entire past that
prevents parallel computation within a sequence."

"Multi-layer convolutional neural networks create hierarchi- cal representations
over the input sequence in which nearby input elements interact at lower layers
while distant ele- ments interact at higher layers. Hierarchical structure pro-
vides a shorter path to capture long-range dependencies compared to the chain
structure modeled by recurrent net- works,"

``In this paper we propose an architecture for sequence to se-
quence modeling that is entirely convolutional. Our model
is equipped with gated linear units (Dauphin et al., 2016)
and residual connections (He et al., 2015a). We also use
attention in every decoder layer and demonstrate that each
attention layer only adds a negligible amount of overhead.
The combination of these choices enables us to tackle large
scale problems''

``The encoder RNN processes an input sequence x =
$(x_1 , \ldots , x_m )$ of m elements and returns state representa-
tions $z = (z_1, \ldots , z_m )$. The decoder RNN takes z and
generates the output sequence $y = (y 1 , \ldots , y_n )$ left to
right, one element at a time. To generate output $y_{i+1}$ , the
decoder computes a new hidden state $h_{i+1}$ based on the
previous state $h_i$ , an embedding $g_i$ of the previous target
language word $y_i$ , as well as a conditional input $c_i$ derived
from the encoder output z."
